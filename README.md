# London Bike-Sharing Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a London bike-sharing dataset to identify usage patterns based on factors like temperature, wind speed, weather conditions, and time of day. The data was cleaned and preprocessed before building an interactive Tableau dashboard to showcase various insights.

The project provides valuable insights into how different weather conditions, time of day, and other factors impact bike usage across London.

## Data Description
The dataset contains records of bike rides, with attributes including:
- `Temperature`: The temperature (°C) at the time of the ride.
- `Wind Speed`: The wind speed (km/h) at the time of the ride.
- `Weather Conditions`: Conditions such as clear skies, rain, snow, etc.
- `Time of Day`: The specific time a ride was taken.
- `Ride Counts`: The number of bikes rented at a given time.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning and preprocessing with the Pandas library.
- **Pandas**: Python library for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Tableau**: Used to build an interactive dashboard to display the analysis visually.

## Visualizations
The Tableau dashboard includes several key visualizations to help analyze the bike-sharing usage patterns:

1. **Moving Average Visualization**: 
   - A filterable graph that allows users to view ride trends over different time periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
   
2. **Heat Map**: 
   - Displays the relationship between temperature (°C) and wind speed (km/h) and how they influence the number of rides.
   
3. **Hourly Bike Usage Analysis**:
   - A visualization that shows the number of rides taken at each hour of the day, helping to identify peak usage times.
   
4. **Weather Impact Section**:
   - A chart that shows how ride counts vary under different weather conditions, such as clear skies, rain, and snow.
